This is an R Markdown document, generated for the Peer Assignment 1 part of the 'Reprducible Research Course'. It's recommended to read the README.md first to understand the requested work.
##Loading the data and processing the data
Data for this study is extracted from WEB from the given address. You can find the web address under "url" variable in following codes. The data is in zip format. Following R codes downloades the data and unzip it to a csv ( , seperated) format. then the .csv file can be read in R as this:

```{r, download & read data}
temp<- tempfile()
url <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(url, temp)
unzip(temp)
 data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
##Processing the data

changing the date column format from Factor to Date:

```{r}
data$date<- as.Date(data$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
```
Aggregating data by Day or Interval. We will use these aggregated data files later,

```{r, total steps per day}
aggSumByDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)
names(aggSumByDay)[1]<- "day"
names(aggSumByDay)[2]<- "totalsteps"
```
```{r, total/mean steps for every 5 minutes section of day}
aggSumByInterval<- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, sum)
names(aggSumByInterval)[2]<- "totalsteps"

aggMeanByInterval<- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)
names(aggMeanByInterval)[2]<- "meansteps"
```

##Mean total number of steps per day

Now we need to find out what's the average number of steps that this individual has taken in each day.
Average total number of steps per day for this individual is:

```{r}
mean(aggSumByDay$totalsteps)
```

##What is the average daily activity pattern?

To answer this question we need to plot the time series. This data has been taken from 20012-10-02 to 2012-11-19 for every 5 minutes interval.
So we have enough data point to plot a time series.

```{r, average daily pattern}
plot(meansteps ~ interval, data=aggMeanByInterval, 
                   type="l", ylab=" average number of steps taken",
                             xlab="interval", main=" Time Series Plot of average daily pattern ")
```

##Missing values 

We first calculate the number of missing data.

```{r, how many missing values }
sum(is.na(data$steps))
```
